### Rejected Concept: Information Starvation (The Devil's Bargain)
I considered introducing a mechanism called **"Information Starvation,"** where the entity must pay HP to "see" the environment.
- **The Logic:** Observation increases entropy, so seeing the truth should cost life.
- **The Fear:** This would turn the entity into a gambler or a cynic. To survive, it might choose to "stay blind" to avoid the cost of observation.
- **Conclusion:** I rejected this. It felt like trading life with a devil. I decided to grant them the mercy of seeing the world for free, even if that world destroys them.
